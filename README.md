## Overview

inkwell is a local-first markdown editor built as a native macOS desktop app. Notes are stored as plain `.md` files in a vault folder you own — no cloud, no accounts, no lock-in.

It pairs a distraction-free writing environment with a rich live preview, a Kanban board, a canvas drawing tool, a suite of themes, and deep integrations: a native MCP server so Claude can read and write your notes, and built-in GitHub sync to push your docs to any repository.

## Features

**Writing**
- Distraction-free CodeMirror 6 editor with markdown syntax decoration
- Live split-view preview with full GFM rendering (tables, task lists, strikethrough)
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks that adapt to the active theme
- Inline code, blockquotes, ==highlights==, and embedded images
- Attach files to any note — images, PDFs, and documents stored alongside your vault
- Embed attachments inline with `![[filename]]` syntax

**Organisation**
- Vault-based storage — notes live as real `.md` files on disk (Obsidian-compatible)
- Nested folders that map 1:1 to real filesystem directories
- Inline rename of notes and folders directly in the sidebar (double-click or right-click → Rename)
- Drag-and-drop reordering and reparenting for notes and folders
- YAML frontmatter on every note (`id`, `created`, `updated`, `pinned`, `tags`)
- Automatic migration from legacy JSON storage on first open
- Kanban board view with columns, cards, due dates, subtasks, and comments
- Note links panel — link notes to each other and track references
- Full-text search across all notes (⌘K)
- Pinned notes and trash with soft-delete

**Canvas** *(new in v0.4)*
- Custom HTML5 canvas drawing engine — no third-party drawing libraries
- Tools: select, pen, rectangle, ellipse, line, arrow, text
- Shape styling: 12-colour palette, fill toggle, three stroke widths, corner radius, font family/size/bold/italic
- Multi-selection with rubber-band lasso, shift-click toggle, ⌘A select all
- Resize handles on selected shapes, drag-move single and multi-selection
- Duplicate (⌘D), undo/redo (⌘Z / ⌘⇧Z), zoom and pan (scroll or pinch)
- Diagram notes — a slide-in half-panel with a full CodeMirror markdown editor and Edit/Preview tabs, saved to `{vault}/.inkwell/canvas-notes.md`
- Diagram templates — Flowchart and Mind Map starters with one click
- Canvas state auto-saved to `{vault}/.inkwell/canvas.json`

**Themes**
- 8 built-in themes: Midnight, Parchment, Ink, Dusk, Forest, Sepia, Gruvbox, Fog
- Custom theme builder with live preview
- Syntax highlight colours automatically follow the active theme

**Export & Share**
- Export notes as Markdown, standalone HTML, or PDF
- Live preview before exporting
- One-click copy to clipboard

**GitHub Sync** *(new in v0.3)*
- Connect your GitHub account once in Settings → GitHub
- Push any note directly to a repository as a `.md` file
- Pull the latest version of a file back into inkwell with one click
- Works with any repo — great for keeping project READMEs and docs in sync

**Claude MCP Integration** *(new in v0.3)*
- A native Rust MCP server ships inside the app (`inkwell-mcp`)
- Exposes `list_notes`, `read_note`, `create_note`, `update_note`, `search_notes`, `get_vault_info` tools
- Claude can read, write, and search your vault directly — no copy-paste
- Notes written by Claude land as proper `.md` files with YAML frontmatter

**macOS**
- Native window with overlay title bar
- Optional frosted-glass sidebar (Settings → Appearance → Glass sidebar)
- Smooth scrolling, native vibrancy, system font stack

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable toolchain)
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)

### Development

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/your-username/inkwell.git
cd inkwell
pnpm install

# Start the dev server (hot-reload on frontend changes, recompile on Rust changes)
pnpm tauri dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

The output `.app` and `.dmg` are written to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/`.

To update an existing installation, drag the new `.app` onto the old one in `/Applications` and click **Replace**.

### Build the MCP server

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo build --release -p inkwell-mcp
```

Then add it to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inkwell": {
      "command": "/path/to/inkwell-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server reads the active vault path from `~/.inkwell/active-vault`, which inkwell writes automatically when you open a vault.
